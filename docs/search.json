The magnitude of these decisions are hard to measure because data is used in many aspects of everyday life such as business, politics, social, etc. Real world data is usually incomplete with missing data."

Multiple imputation for missing data has emerged as the primary solution however, many considerations are needed for analysis.

The methods of imputation are designed for MAR type of missing data.\nMCAR missing type of data is somewhat unrealistic because you would be omitting variables without relationships to the result."
